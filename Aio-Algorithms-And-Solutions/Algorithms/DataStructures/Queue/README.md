# Queue

## Overview
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are inserted at the end (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue) of the queue.

## Characteristics
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- Elements are added at the end and removed from the front
- Access to elements is restricted to front and rear
- Can be implemented using array or linked list

## Complexity
- Enqueue: O(1)
- Dequeue: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## Basic Operations
- Enqueue (add element)
- Dequeue (remove element)
- Peek (view front element)
- IsEmpty
- Size

## Implementation
The implementation is available in three languages:
- C#
- Java
- Python

## Common Problems
- Task scheduling
- Buffer management
- Breadth-First Search
- Print queue management
