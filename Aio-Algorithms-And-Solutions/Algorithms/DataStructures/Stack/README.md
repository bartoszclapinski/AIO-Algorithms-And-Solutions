# Stack

## Overview
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be inserted and removed only from one end, called the top of the stack.

## Characteristics
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
- Elements are added and removed from the same end
- Access to elements is restricted to the top
- Can be implemented using array or linked list

## Complexity
- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

## Basic Operations
- Push (add element)
- Pop (remove element)
- Peek (view top element)
- IsEmpty
- Size

## Implementation
The implementation is available in three languages:
- C#
- Java
- Python

## Common Problems
- Balanced parentheses
- Expression evaluation
- Function call management
- Undo operations
