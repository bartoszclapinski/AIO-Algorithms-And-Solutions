# Linked List

## Overview
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element (node) contains data and a reference to the next element in the sequence.

## Types of Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

## Characteristics
- Dynamic size
- Non-contiguous memory allocation
- Efficient insertion and deletion
- No random access

## Complexity
- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion at beginning: O(1)
- Insertion at end: O(1) with tail reference
- Deletion: O(1) after finding the element

## Basic Operations
- Insertion (at beginning, at end, after element)
- Deletion
- Search
- Traversal
- Reversal

## Implementation
The implementation is available in three languages:
- C#
- Java
- Python

## Common Problems
- Cycle detection
- Finding middle element
- List reversal
- Merging sorted lists
