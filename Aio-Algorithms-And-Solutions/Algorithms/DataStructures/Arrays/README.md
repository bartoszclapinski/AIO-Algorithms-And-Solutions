# Arrays

## Overview

An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure where each element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.

## Characteristics
- Fixed size (in most implementations)
- Continuous memory allocation
- Random access (O(1))
- Cache-friendly

## Complexity
- Access: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: O(n)
- Deletion: O(n)

## Basic Operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search
- Traverse
- Update

## Implementation
The implementation is available in three languages:
- C#
- Java
- Python

## Common Problems
- Array Rotation
- Finding Maximum/Minimum
- Array Reversal
- Finding Duplicates
