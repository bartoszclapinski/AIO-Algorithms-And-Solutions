# AIO Algorithms and Solutions

Welcome to `aio-algorithms-and-solutions`, a comprehensive repository containing solutions for popular programming challenges and important algorithm implementations.

## Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

1. `solutions` - Contains the solutions for programming challenges from platforms like HackerRank, CoderByte, and Exercism.
2. `algorithms` - Contains implementation of various algorithms.

### Solutions

The solutions directory is further divided into subdirectories for each platform:

#### [HackerRank](./Aio-Algorithms-And-Solutions/Solutions/HackerRank/README.md)

The solutions for HackerRank are written in C#, Java, and Python.

#### [CoderByte](./solutions/coderbyte/README.md)

The solutions for CoderByte are currently only in C#.

#### [Exercism](./solutions/exercism/README.md)

The solutions for Exercism are currently only in C#
