# AIO Algorithms and Solutions

Welcome to `aio-algorithms-and-solutions`, a comprehensive repository containing solutions for popular programming challenges and important algorithm implementations.

## Important Note

These solutions are provided as a final resort in case you are stuck and need help to progress further. While you are encouraged to understand and learn from these solutions, please avoid just copying and pasting the code. The purpose of solving these challenges is to learn and grow as a programmer. Only by actively engaging with the problem, you will be able to improve your problem-solving and coding skills.

## Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

1. `solutions` - Contains the solutions for programming challenges from platforms like HackerRank, CoderByte, and Exercism.
2. `algorithms` - Contains implementation of various algorithms.

### Solutions

The solutions directory is further divided into subdirectories for each platform:

#### [HackerRank](./Aio-Algorithms-And-Solutions/Solutions/HackerRank/README.md)

The solutions for HackerRank are written in C#, Java, and Python.

#### [CoderByte](./Aio-Algorithms-And-Solutions/Solutions/Coderbyte/README.md)

The solutions for CoderByte are currently only in C#.

#### [Exercism](./Aio-Algorithms-And-Solutions/Solutions/Exercism/README.md)

The solutions for Exercism are written in C# and Java
